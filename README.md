OList is an e-commerce company that has faced some losses recently and they want to manage their inventory very well so as to reduce any unnecessary costs that they might be bearing. Now to be able to meet the demands of the customers, the company would need to store tons and tons of products in warehouses. Since storing these products adds to the costs that the company incurs, it is necessary for the organization to plan their inventory well.

# Business Goal
To manage the inventory cost of OList and secondly to identify top products that contribute to the revenue and also use market basket analysis to analyse the purchase behaviour of individual customers to estimate with relative certainty, what items are more likely to be purchased individually or in combination with some other products.
